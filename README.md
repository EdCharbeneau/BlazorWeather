# Blazor Weather

A Blazor Weather sample app that shows the current weather for your current location and a collection of pinned locations.

## Setup

You'll need an [Accuweather API key](https://developer.accuweather.com/) to use their services. You can sign up for a free trial - just be aware it's only good for 50 requests/day. 

## Credits

The weather is supplied by [Accuweather](https://www.accuweather.com/). 

Geolocation is handled using [Darnton.Blazor.DeviceInterop](https://github.com/darnton/BlazorDeviceInterop).

Local storage is handled using [Blazored.LocalStorage](https://github.com/blazored/LocalStorage).
